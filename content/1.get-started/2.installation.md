::callout
This module requires Nuxt `3.7.0`. If you must use an older Nuxt version, this module should work as long as you are using Nitro > `2.6.0` and h3 > `1.8.0`.
::

You can use this package in any Nuxt project.
Create a new project from scratch with the official Nuxt CLI

::code-group
```bash [npm]
npx nuxi init
```
```bash [pnpm]
pnpx nuxi init
```
```bash [yarn]
yarn dlx nuxi init
```
```bash [bun]
bunx nuxi init
```
::

Install the form-actions module from NPM :

::code-group
```bash [npm]
npm install @hebilicious/form-actions-nuxt
```
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @hebilicious/form-actions-nuxt
```
```bash [yarn]
yarn add @hebilicious/form-actions-nuxt
```
```bash [bun]
bun install @hebilicious/form-actions-nuxt
```
::

Add it to `modules` in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ["@hebilicious/form-actions-nuxt"]
})
```

That's it ! You can now use form actions in your Nuxt project.
