title: Server Loaders
description: Use server loaders to load data in your pages and components.
---

Server Loaders are a convenient way to load data from the server in your pages components.
They can be used as an alternative to `useFetch` and `useAsyncData`, and other data fetching mechanisms.
Under the hood, server loaders will create regular Nitro server handlers, meaning that they will _always_ run on the server. The returned data will be serialized and sent to the client, which means that while hydrating, they will run only once.

## Basic Usage

Server loaders _must_ be defined in the `/server/actions` directory. Let's start by creating a server loader in `/server/actions/books.ts` :

```ts [/server/actions/books.ts]
export const loader = defineServerLoader(async () => {
  // This composable accepts an h3 event handler, you can use any logic that you
  // want here, including database calls, etc.
  return { books: ["title"], manybooks: [] }
})
```

::callout
The file name is _very_ important and will be used for the name of the loader (relative to `/server/actions`).
::

::callout
Your file _must_ use a `loader` named export.
::

Your loader is now ready to use in `pages` and `components`.

Let's create a Book component to illustrate the usage.
  
```vue [components/Books.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { result } = await useLoader("books")
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Books</h1>
    {{ result }} <!-- result will be typed like this : { books: string[]; manybooks: never[];} | null -->
  </div>
</template>
```

**Note:** This is very similar to `useFetch` and API routes. In fact, this module uses `useFetch` under the hood.

## Using dynamic routes and parameters

You can use route parameters in your server loaders. Let's update our book loader to accept parameters and return them.

```ts [/server/actions/books.ts]
export const loader = defineServerLoader(async (event) => {
  // Use H3 helpers to grab the requests params
  const params = getQuery(event)
  return { books: ["title"], manybooks: [], params }
})
```

Now we can use this loader in a [dynamic route](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages#dynamic-routes) like `pages/books/[id].vue` :

```vue [pages/books/(id).vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { result } = await useLoader("books")
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Params</h1>
    {{ result.params }} <!-- params will be typed like this : { id: string } -->
  </div>
</template>
```

## Using loader options

You can pass options to your loader using the `useLoader` 2nd argument. A subset of the [useFetch options](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-fetch#type) are supported.

You can specify watch sources to automatically reload your loader. This is useful if you want to reload your loader when a specific store value changes.
You can also specify custom query parameters :

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const { result } = await useLoader("books", { params: { id: "1" } })
</script>
```

**Note:** `useLoader` 2nd argument and `useFormAction({ loaderOptions })` can both be used to pass loader options to the underlying `useFetch` call.

Here's the typescript signature of the accepted options :

```ts
interface LoaderOptions {
  watch?: MultiWatchSources
  params?: SearchParameters
}
```
