## What are form actions and server loaders

- Form Actions are a convenient way to send data to your server using native HTML forms that can be progressively enhanced.
- Server Loaders are a convenient way to load type-safe data from your server into your pages and components, without manually fetching from an API route.

## Why is this module not included in Nuxt by default ?
